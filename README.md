## Password Generator

## Description
This is the solution for the challenge from EdX bootcamp, Week 5, Day 4.
Durin Week 5 at the bootcamp, I learnt advanvced Javascript and my task was to apply the skills I got and create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected by modifying starter code. This app runs in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code I wrote. It has a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

The criteria I need to take into account are the following:

Generate a password when the button is clicked:
  1. Present a series of prompts for password criteria
   1.1. Length of password
   1.2. At least 8 characters but no more than 128.
  2. Character types
   2.1.Lowercase
   2.2. Uppercase
   2.3. Numeric
   2.4. Special characters ($@%&*, etc)
  3. Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected
  4. Once prompts are answered then the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page
